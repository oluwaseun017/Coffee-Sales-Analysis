## Introduction

This project aims is to dive into coffee sales data to uncover valuable insights into sales performance over time, broken down by country, and to identify our top customers. I will be using Excel for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data to bring these insights to life.

## Problem Statement

The coffee sales company is grappling with understanding how well it's doing in sales across different aspects like time, location, and customer types. The data is scattered across different places, which makes it hard to find useful insights. Because of this, the company can't figure out important sales trends, which products are doing the best, or who their most valuable customers are. This lack of clarity is making it tough for the company to make smart choices, improve their marketing plans, and grow their sales. The main goal here is to gather and analyze all the coffee sales data so they can uncover these insights and start making decisions based on solid information.

## Data Source

The dataset for this analysis was obtained from a YouTube channel and is available on GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx). It includes three main tables:
- Order Table: Contains details about each order, including Order ID,	Order Date,	Customer ID,	Product ID, and	Quantity.
- Customer Table: Contains customer information such as Customer ID,	Customer Name,	Email,	Phone Number,	Address Line 1,	City,	Country, Postcode, and	Loyalty Card.
- Product Table: Contains product details including Product ID,	Coffee Type,	Roast Type,	Size,	Unit Price,	Price per 100g,	Profit
